### Tech Stack
We started with a single SvelteKit fullstack service running on Cloudflare Workers, but SvelteKit's fullstack capabilities weren't as comprehensive as we needed, and Cloudflare KV had terrible latency. Eventually we split out frontend and API services - the frontend is supposed to fetch and modify data only through the API, but right now the transition isn't fully finished and the frontend is still hitting the database directly on some old pages.

- Frontend: SvelteKit 5, TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4
- Backend: Elysia.js (Bun runtime), PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Discord bot: rust using poise/serenity
- Deployment: Kubernetes with Flux GitOps
