      <h1>A Learnable Meta World maps</h1>
      <p>
        When someone wants to improve at GeoGuessr, they often try to memorize lists of bollards,
        signs, Google cars, and other clues. This can be quite overwhelming because there are so
        many different details to remember. I tried teaching my friends some of these "metas" by
        playing the world map with them and pointing out specific clues, but by the time those clues
        appeared again, they had already forgotten them. To help with this, I created several maps
        that highlight the most common "metas" - anything from landscapes, bollards, and signs to
        unique Google Street View cars that are useful to learn at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there might be other maps like this available, ours include a script that shows a note
        about the location after you make your guess in GeoGuessr, explaining each round and
        highlighting the clues you might have missed that could help you identify the country. The
        map is designed for No Move because it's skill itself to find clues and it's good habbit to
        learn to check google car, poles, roadlines etc.

      <h2 class="mt-4 mb-[-10px]">How to use</h2>
      <p>
        To get helpful hints in GeoGuessr, you'll need a browser extension that allows you to run
        userscripts, such as
        <strong>Tampermonkey</strong>. If you’ve used other popular userscripts like GeoGuessr
        Training Mode, you might already be familiar with it. But if this is your first time hearing
        about it, don't worry—it's easy to set up.

            First, you need to install a userscript manager extension for your browser. Tampermonkey
            is available for
            <a
              href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo"

            Once you have the extension installed, you can install the userscript by clicking
            <a

              target="_blank">this link</a
            >. Make sure to open new window with geoguessr after installing the script for first
            time.
            <p>
              The userscript is open-source and <a
